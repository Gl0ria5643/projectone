      A Tale of Two Cities is a historical novel published in 1859 by Charles
      Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution.
      The novel tells the story of the French Doctor Manette, his 18-year-long
      imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris, and his release to live in London
      with his daughter Lucie whom he had never met. The story is set against
      the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of
      Terror. As Dickens's best-known work of historical fiction, A Tale of Two
      Cities is said to be one of the best-selling novels of all time.[2][3][4]
      In 2003, the novel was ranked 63rd on the BBC's The Big Read poll.[5] The
      novel has been adapted for film, television, radio, and the stage, and has
      continued to influence popular culture

      It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
      wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
      the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
      Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
      everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
      to Heaven, we were all going direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was
      so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
      insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
      degree of comparison only.[6]
